- [x] Improve similarity metrics for titles to reduce number of duplicates. => good first issue.
  - [ ] Chose canonical urls when more than one piece with a similar title is present, both on server and on client.
  - [x] client/articles/main.go => isSourceRepeat <= más fácil?
  - server/.../filters.go => too complicated to order on the server rn

  - [ ] Forecaster suggestions => this could be a whole thing
  - [ ] Neuters.de <https://neuters.de/> shows what seems to be the most recent 10K news??
  - [ ] AP news?
  - [ ] News API
  - [ ] Reuters/AP/AFP
  - [ ] Jihadi Watch
  - [ ] https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/4th-november-threat-intelligence-report/
  - [ ] Various press releases, e.g., from US military <https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2024/11/mil-241112-dod01.htm>

Improve ops:

- [ ] Automatically deal with logs getting large, including syslogs
- [ ] Even better deduplication
  - [ ] Move client dedup & filtering to server
- [ ] Delete processed items regularly (psql $DATABASE_URL; DELETE from sources WHERE processed = TRUE;)
   - Middle east, Spain, US, UK, Ukraine, etc. maybe start with no keyword first.
   - [ ] Added fast way to do this to makefile
   - ... or not. Maybe leaving old items there is ok, and they could be useful at some point.
     - maybe also interesting to classify them as useful/not useful to improve filtering
- [ ] Make filters common for client and server, so that if I add them to client then they are soon after added to server after a git push
- [ ] Add table for all titles in postgres.
- [ ] Move filtering earlier, on the server side.
  - Maybe also add to postgres
- [ ] Think a bit more about deduplication. Right now we only check for dupes for items which already are in the database. But this means that we can't filter items we have already discarded. So we have a surprising degree of redundancy that would be good to fix.
  - Maybe save items that pass some initial filters?
  - Could get large.

## v2

- [x] Research different databases and possible architectures
- [x] Move output to postgres rather than email for galerts

- [x] Move gdelt over to v2
- [x] Add filtering capabilities to client
- [x] Delete v1 repo and move v2 over to top level
- [~] Deduplicate code in various sources once the abstractions become a bit clearer
  - [x] Reduce deduplication of common code while avoiding early abstractions that later are a bit expensive to get over.
- [x] Send cropped title to database and check for duplicates based on the filtered title
- [x] Group items in prospector by keyword, and present them together for ease of process.
- [x] Add better filtering to the client

- [x] Rotate through forecasters' emails to keep the workload manageable?
  - Workload should also become more manageable after the initial deluge.
- [x] Send one big email instead of many small ones?
- [x] Get a sense of the volume of news every day, and think about how to distribute them between forecasters
- [x] Get fewer repeats. Possible strategies:
  - [x] Keep list of titles?
  - Paste everything into one article and then ask GPT itself to remove/combine duplicates?
    - GPT-4-o
  - Take the loss?
  - Use a cheaper model? gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 is 20x cheaper
