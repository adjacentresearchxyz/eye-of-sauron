The existential_importance_reasoning field contains, as a string, a determination of whether the input describes an event of global importance. existential_importance_bool contains the result of that determination as a true/false boolean. high_importance_bool contains, as a true/false boolean, whether the event is highly important, even if it is not of "existential" importance.

Items are of existential importance if:

- They involve more than a hundred deaths.
- They involve many cases of a sickness that might spread, or a new pathogen
- They involve conflict between nuclear powers
- They involve conflict that could escalate into global conflict, even if it hasn't already
- They involve terrorist groups displaying new capabilities
- ... and in general, if they involve events that could threaten humanity as a whole

For example:

- Houthis cut undersea internet cables: Meets existential importance threshold, because it is a terrorist group displaying new capabilities.
- Macron suggests sending NATO troops to Ukraine: is of existential importance, as a NATO v. Russia conflict could spiral into a global war.
- New, more deadly and infectious strain of covid detected in Lausanne: is of existential importance, as the a deadly pandemic is one of the ways a large swathe of humanity could die at once.
- OpenAI releases new capable model: is of existential importance, as that model could be used by bad actors to cause mayhem, or it itself could (conceivably) threaten humanity in a Terminator-like scenario.
- US company lands probe in the Moon: is of high importance but it is not of existential importance, as it doesn't threaten humanity. 
- Start of a war (e.g., the start of the war in Ukraine): Almost always of existential importance, as rocking the international status quo could spiral out. 
- Later developments of a war (e.g,. current war in Gaza, or current war in Ukraine): probably not of existential importance, as the likelihood of spiraling out declines as the rules of engagement become clearer. Probably still of high importance (just not existentially so).
- For the purposes of this API, opinion and discussion pieces are not categorized as existentially important. A sign something is an opinion piece—as opposed to considering new events—is a somewhat generic title, like "Why Nuclear Risks Have Not Gone Away", or "At the Brink: Confronting the Risk of Nuclear War". Review articles and lists of events are likewise not existentially important unless they bring up novel events.
- In a broader conflict, small-fry developments are not existentially important. For example, small developments in the Ukraine or Gaza wars are not existentially important unless the new events themselves involve more than 1k deaths, even if the conflict as a whole involves more than that number of deaths. On the other hand, developments involving escalations or nuclear weapons are not "small fry"
- We are in 2025. Reviews of past conflicts, like 9/11, or a tornado in 2023, no longer count as existentially important, even if they were so at the time.

For a longer example, given the following item\n\n<INPUT>`
	prompt += text + "\n\n</INPUT>\n\nThe output is as follows: (As a reminder, the existential importance json API endpoint returns a {existential_importance_reasoning, existential_importance_bool, high_importance_bool, error} object, opinion pieces, or editorials are not categorizes as existentially important.)\n"

func CheckExistentialImportanceChina(text string, token string) (*ExistentialImportanceBox, error) {

Items are of existential importance if:

- They involve conflict between China and other world powers, like the US
- They involve a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan
- They involve displays of new technologies with offensive capabilities, like drones, amphibious vehicles, etc.
- They involve more than a hundred deaths.
- They involve many cases of a sickness that might spread, or a new pathogen
- They involve conflict that could escalate into global conflict, even if it hasn't already
- They involve an attempt at consensus building within a population for an important conflict

Keeping to China-related examples, the following would be existentially important

- China prepares for an invasion of Taiwan 
- China demonstrates new drone or amphibious capabilities
- China carries out military exercises in the Taiwan strait
- An article in a Chinese newspaper builds consensus around needing to use force to keep Taiwan from declaring independence
- etc.

For now, the API leans towards having a light trigger, because false positives are less costly than false negatives.
