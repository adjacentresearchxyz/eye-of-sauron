# Existential news prospector   

## About 

This is a program that surveys many sources on the internet to find existentially important news—operationally defined as events that could kill over 1M people, and precursors thereof. 

The main sources we are parsing are:

- Google news
- [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/)
- Chinese military news from mil.gmw.cn 
- Wikipedia current events
- Twitter (WIP)

News are first parsed on a server, filtered using LLMs, and then manually filtered with the UI defined in the client folder. The results are then discussed by forecasters and aggregated into the [Sentinel minutes](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/).

## Built with

- Linux
- Golang
- Ncurses
- Postgres
- OpenAI
- Systemd 

## Getting started

Install [golang](https://go.dev/). 

Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:NunoSempere/analyze-news.git`. You might need to e.g., have ssh keys configured with github, since it's a private repository

### Getting started with the server

Configure .env files. You can see .env.example files, but the easiest way is probably to ask Nuño either for the .env contents, or for authorization for our production server.

```
cd server
make run-galerts
make run-gdelt
make run-gmw
# make run twitter # wip 
```

There are also makefile recipes for setting up systemd services, which is what we actually use in production.

If the server is running these processes, you can listen to them with

```
make listen-galerts
make listen-gdelt
make listen-gmw
```

### Getting started with the client

Configure the .env files, then 

```
cd client/articles
make 
```

You will see a ncurses based application, which looks as follows.

Actions you can do from this screen are:

- navigate between items and pages with the arrow keys
- mark/unmark an item as processed with x
- mark/unmark a whole page as processed with X
- filter out for keywords with f (then write the keyword, then press enter). This is particularly useful for filtering duplicates quickly.
- open in browser. This might require to customize the logic for your OS+browser combination
- save to a file. You can configure which folder in the .env file.
- expand the items with enter to also show their summary

Similarly, for the wip twitter client:

```
cd client/tweets
make 
```

## Roadmap and contributions

You can see our roadmap in docs/ROADMAP.md, as well as some notes on coding standards on docs/CODING.md 

If you have access to this repository, contributions are welcome. 

## Licensing

This repository is part of the unique Sentinel alpha, so we're hesitant to release it with an open source version so far.
